## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to impact evaluation. Can we improve vaccination in India with small nudges? Is pollution harmful in China? Does it matter to belong to the ethnic group of an elected official when it comes to employment? Does it really matter to have an extra year of schooling for income years later? If yes, what is the magnitude of these effects? How much should you trust these results? The answer to these questions determines public policy and inform debates about development issues.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the main research designs used for impact evaluation. This includes the understanding of the statistical tools used, the ability to replicate research papers or perform their own analysis using R and interpret the results.

## Instructional Method

**Structure** -- The course is divided in 2 parts. Classes 1 through 10 are designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of statistics and causal inference. In the second part, we will study different research designs and learn about how they work and when one should use them.

**Book** -- There is no required textbook for this course. Information provided during lectures and in the slides will be sufficient to write the exams. I will be providing students with several sets of practice questions during the course, and will not use exercises from any textbook. For those students who would like to refer to a textbook during this course you have several possibilities:

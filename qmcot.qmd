## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to impact evaluation. Can we improve vaccination in Pakistan with small nudges? Is pollution harmful in China? Can we improve aid distribution mechanism among flood victims? Does it really matter to have an extra year of schooling for income years later? If yes, what is the magnitude of these effects? How much should you trust these results? The answer to these questions determines public policy and inform debates about development issues.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be familiar with tools to be applied for program evaluation and better understand research design. This includes the understanding of the statistical tools used, the ability to replicate research papers or perform their own analysis using R and interpret the results.

## Instructional Method

**Structure** -- The course has 3 main parts: revision of application of some basic techniques of regression analysis, statistical inference to introduce students to the fundamentals of statistics and causal inference. In the third part, we will study different research designs and learn about how they work and when one should use them.

## Books

I will be providing students with several sets of practice questions during the course. For those students who would like to refer to a textbook during this course you have several possibilities:

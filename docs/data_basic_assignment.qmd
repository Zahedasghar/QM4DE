**Objective**: Practice data manipulation, merging, and visualization using basics of R and STATA


### Step 1: Create Your Own Data Frames

**Task**: Start by creating the following data frames.

#### Data Frame 1: Employee Details
| EmployeeID | Name     | Department |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | Alina    | Sales      |
| 2          | Boby      | IT         |

| 4          | Daud   | Marketing  |
| 5          | Hajra      | Finance    |

#### Data Frame 2: Salary Information
| EmployeeID | Salary  |
|------------|---------|
| 2          | 50000   |
| 4          | 60000   |
| 5          | 55000   |
| 6          | 65000   |
| 7          | 70000   |

#### Data Frame 3: Performance Ratings
| EmployeeID | Rating      |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | Excellent   |
| 3          | Good        |
| 5          | Very Good   |
| 7          | Outstanding |

**Instructions**: 

1. Create the data frames based on the tables provided. 

2. Save the data frames for later use.

### Step 2: Experiment with Different Combination Methods

Combine the employee and salary data frames.

### Step 3: Handling Missing Values

**Task**: Identify employees who are missing salary information and salary records that do not have employee details.

**Instructions**:
- Identify and isolate the records that have missing values.
- Ensure that missing data is clearly marked and analyze its implications.

### Step 4: Create a Summary

**Task 1**: Calculate the average salary 
**Task 2**: Find the highest-paid employee


### Step 5: Challenge - Combine All Three Data Frames

**Task**: Combine the three data frames into a single comprehensive dataset that includes employee details, salaries, and performance ratings.

### Step 6: Visualization

**Task 1**: Create a scatter plot of salary vs. performance rating.  
**Task 2**: Make a bar plot showing the average salary by department.

**Instructions**:
- Use data visualization techniques to create informative graphs.
- Label axes and include titles to enhance clarity.
